- Enhanced DNS information coverage including IPv6, mail servers, and verification records

### Changed
- DIG ANY queries now perform multiple record type lookups instead of single query
- Improved DIG output format with clear section separation
- Enhanced MCP server with updated DIG functionality
- Better error handling for failed record type queries

### Fixed
- DIG ANY queries now return comprehensive DNS information instead of single A record
- Resolved DNS server blocking issues with ANY queries by using multiple specific queries

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-19

### Added

- Enhanced contact table with row separation
- Test script for demonstrating full contact display (`test_contact_display.py`)
- Comprehensive documentation (`CONTACT_INFORMATION.md`)

### Changed
- Improved `format_contact()` function to show all available fields
- Updated contact table layout with `show_lines=True` for better readability
- Enhanced vCard parsing to store both `'fn'` and `'name'` fields

### Documentation
